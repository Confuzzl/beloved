                            Don't fall asleep when she braids your hair.<br />
                            She is the laugh; I am the laughter.<br />
                            I watch the house; I watch the yard.<br />
                            She left me.<br />
                            Daddy is coming for us.<br />
                            A hot thing.<br />

                            You are my sister<br />
                            You are my daughter<br />
                            You are my face; you are me<br />
                            I have found you again; you have come back to me<br />
                            You are my Beloved<br />
                            You are mine<br />
                            You are mine<br />
                            You are mine<br />

                        <p>
                            I have your milk<br />
                            I have your smile<br />
                            I will take care of you<br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You are my face; I am you.<br />
                            Why did you leave me who am you?<br />
                            I will never leave you again<br />
                            Don't ever leave me again<br />
                            You will never leave me again<br />
                            You went in the water<br />
                            I drank your blood<br />
                            I brought your milk<br />
                            You forgot to smile<br />
                            I loved you<br />
                            You hurt me<br />
                            You came back to me<br />
                            You left me<br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I waited for you<br />
                            You are mine<br />
                            You are mine<br />
                            You are mine<br />
