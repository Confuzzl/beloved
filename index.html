                        I AM BELOVED and she is mine. I see her take flowers
                        away from leaves&emsp;she puts them in a round
                        basket&emsp;the leaves are not for her&emsp;she fills
                        the basket&emsp;she opens the grass&emsp;I would help
                        her but the clouds are in the way&emsp;how can I say
                        things that are pictures&emsp;I am not separate

                        never be a time when I am not crouching and watching
                        others who are crouching too&emsp;I am always
                        crouching&emsp;the man on my face is dead&emsp;his face
                        is not mine his mouth smells sweet but his eyes are
                        locked

                        dead man on my face&emsp;daylight comes through the
                        cracks and I can see his locked eyes&emsp;I am not

                        do it &emsp;if we had more to drink we could make
                        tears&emsp;we cannot make sweat or morning water so the

                        a small bird trembling&emsp;there is no room to tremble
                        so he is not able to die&emsp;my own dead man is pulled

                        We are not crouching&emsp;now we are standing but my
                        legs are like my dead man's eyes&emsp;I cannot fall
                        because there is no room to&emsp;the men without skin

                        sun closes my eyes&emsp;those able to die are in a
                        pile&emsp;I cannot find my man&emsp;the one whose teeth
                        I have loved&emsp;a hot thing&emsp;the little hill of

                        had the teeth of the man who died on my face I would
                        bite the circle around her neck&emsp;bite it away&emsp;I
                        know she does not like it&emsp;now there is room to
                        crouch and to watch the crouching others&emsp;it is the
                        crouching that is now always now&emsp;inside&emsp;the

                        In the beginning I could see her&emsp;I could not help
                        her because the clouds were in the way&emsp;in the
                        beginning I could see her&emsp;the shining in her

                        neck&emsp;I know this&emsp;I look hard at her so she
                        will know that the clouds are in the way&emsp;I am sure
                        she saw me&emsp;I am looking at her see me&emsp;she
                        empties out her eyes&emsp;I am there in the place where
                        her face is&emsp;and telling her the noisy clouds were
                        in my way&emsp;she wants her earrings&emsp;she wants her
                        round basket&emsp;I want her face&emsp;a hot thing

                        in the beginning the women are away from the men and the
                        men are away from the women&emsp;storms rock us and mix
                        the men into the women and the women into the
                        men&emsp;that is when I begin to be on the back of the
                        man&emsp;for a long time I see only his neck and his
                        wide shoulders above me&emsp;I am small&emsp;I love him
                        because he has a song&emsp;when he turned around to die
                        I see the teeth he sang through&emsp;his singing was
                        soft&emsp;his singing is of the place where a woman
                        takes flowers away from their leaves and puts them in a
                        round basket&emsp;before the clouds&emsp;she is
                        crouching near us&emsp;but I do not see her until he
                        locks his eyes and dies on my face&emsp;we are that
                        way&emsp;there is no breath coming from his mouth and
                        the place where breath should be is
                        sweet-smelling&emsp;the others do not know he is
                        dead&emsp;I know&emsp;his song is gone&emsp;now I love
                        his pretty little teeth instead

                        I AM BELOVED and she is mine. Sethe is the one that
                        picked flowers, yellow flowers in the place before the
                        crouching. Took them away from their green leaves. They
                        are on the quilt now where we sleep. She was about to
                        smile at me when the men without skin came and took us
                        up into the sunlight with the dead and shoved them into
                        the sea. Sethe went into the sea. She went there. They
                        did not push her. She went there. She was getting ready
                        to smile at me and when she saw the dead people pushed
                        into the sea she went also and left me there with no
                        face or hers. Sethe is the face I found and lost in the
                        water under the bridge. When I went in, I saw her face
                        coming to me and it was my face too. I wanted to join. I
                        tried to join, but she went up into the pieces of light
                        at the top of the water. I lost her again, but I found
                        the house she whispered to me and there she was, smiling
                        at last. It's good, but I cannot lose her again. All I
                        want to know is why did she go in the water in the place
                        where we crouched? Why did she do that when she was just
                        about to smile at me? I wanted to join her in the sea
                        but I could not move; I wanted to help her when she was
                        picking the flowers, but the clouds of gunsmoke blinded
                        me and I lost her. Three times I lost her: once with the
                        flowers because of the noisy clouds of smoke; once when
                        she went into the sea instead of smiling at me; once
                        under the bridge when I went in to j oin her and she
                        came toward me but did not smile. She whispered to me,
                        chewed me, and swam away. Now I have found her in this
                        house. She smiles at me and it is my own face smiling. I
                        will not lose her again. She is mine.

                    <p>
                        Tell me the truth. Didn't you come from the other
                        side?<br />
                        Yes. I was on the other side.<br />
                        You came back because of me?<br />
                        Yes.<br />
                        You rememory me?<br />
                        Yes. I remember you.<br />
                        You never forgot me?<br />
                        Your face is mine.<br />
                        Do you forgive me? Will you stay? You safe here now.<br />
                        Where are the men without skin? <br />
                        Out there. Way off.<br />
                        Can they get in here?<br />
                        No. They tried that once, but I stopped them. They won't
                        ever come back. <br />
                        One of them was in the house I was in. He hurt me.
                        <br />
                        They can't hurt us no more.<br />
                        Where are your earrings?<br />
                        They took them from me.<br />
                        The men without skin took them?<br />
                        Yes. <br />
                        I was going to help you but the clouds got in the
                        way.<br />
                        There're no clouds here.<br />
                        If they put an iron circle around your neck I will bite
                        it away.<br />
                        Beloved. <br />
                        I will make you a round basket.<br />
                        You're back. You're back.<br />
                        Will we smile at me?<br />
                        Can't you see I'm smiling?<br />
                        I love your face.<br />

                        We played by the creek.<br />
                        I was there in the water.<br />
                        In the quiet time, we played.<br />
                        The clouds were noisy and in the way.<br />
                        When I needed you, you came to be with me.<br />
                        I needed her face to smile.<br />
                        I could only hear breathing.<br />
                        The breathing is gone; only the teeth are left.<br />
                        She said you wouldn't hurt me.<br />
                        She hurt me.<br />
                        I will protect you.<br />
                        I want her face.<br />
                        Don't love her too much.<br />
                        I am loving her too much.<br />
                        Watch out for her; she can give you dreams.<br />
                        She chews and swallows.<br />
                        Don't fall asleep when she braids your hair.<br />
                        She is the laugh; I am the laughter.<br />
                        I watch the house; I watch the yard.<br />
                        She left me.<br />
                        Daddy is coming for us.<br />
                        A hot thing.<br />

                        You will never leave me again<br />
                        You went in the water<br />
                        I drank your blood<br />
                        I brought your milk<br />
                        You forgot to smile<br />
                        I loved you<br />
                        You hurt me<br />
                        You came back to me<br />
                        You left me<br />
                        I waited for you<br />
