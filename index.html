              I AM BELOVED and she is mine. Sethe is the one that picked
              flowers, yellow flowers in the place before the crouching. Took
              them away from their green leaves. They are on the quilt now where
              we sleep. She was about to smile at me when the men without skin
              came and took us up into the sunlight with the dead and shoved
              them into the sea. Sethe went into the sea. She went there. They
              did not push her. She went there. She was getting ready to smile
              at me and when she saw the dead people pushed into the sea she
              went also and left me there with no face or hers. Sethe is the
              face I found and lost in the water under the bridge. When I went
              in, I saw her face coming to me and it was my face too. I wanted
              to join. I tried to join, but she went up into the pieces of light
              at the top of the water. I lost her again, but I found the house
              she whispered to me and there she was, smiling at last. It's good,
              but I cannot lose her again. All I want to know is why did she go
              in the water in the place where we crouched? Why did she do that
              when she was just about to smile at me? I wanted to join her in
              the sea but I could not move; I wanted to help her when she was
              picking the flowers, but the clouds of gunsmoke blinded me and I
              lost her. Three times I lost her: once with the flowers because of
              the noisy clouds of smoke; once when she went into the sea instead
              of smiling at me; once under the bridge when I went in to j oin
              her and she came toward me but did not smile. She whispered to me,
              chewed me, and swam away. Now I have found her in this house. She
              smiles at me and it is my own face smiling. I will not lose her
              again. She is mine.

              Tell me the truth. Didn't you come from the other side?<br />
              Yes. I was on the other side.<br />
              You came back because of me?<br />
              Yes.<br />
              You rememory me?<br />
              Yes. I remember you.<br />
              You never forgot me?<br />
              Your face is mine.<br />
              Do you forgive me? Will you stay? You safe here now.<br />
              Where are the men without skin? <br />
              Out there. Way off.<br />
              Can they get in here?<br />
              No. They tried that once, but I stopped them. They won't ever come
              back. <br />
              One of them was in the house I was in. He hurt me.
              <br />
              They can't hurt us no more.<br />
              Where are your earrings?<br />
              They took them from me.<br />
              The men without skin took them?<br />
              Yes. <br />
              I was going to help you but the clouds got in the way.<br />
              There're no clouds here.<br />
              If they put an iron circle around your neck I will bite it
              away.<br />
              Beloved. <br />
              I will make you a round basket.<br />
              You're back. You're back.<br />
              Will we smile at me?<br />
              Can't you see I'm smiling?<br />
              I love your face.<br />

              We played by the creek.<br />
              I was there in the water.<br />
              In the quiet time, we played.<br />
              The clouds were noisy and in the way.<br />
              When I needed you, you came to be with me.<br />
              I needed her face to smile.<br />
              I could only hear breathing.<br />
              The breathing is gone; only the teeth are left.<br />
              She said you wouldn't hurt me.<br />
              She hurt me.<br />
              I will protect you.<br />
              I want her face.<br />
              Don't love her too much.<br />
              I am loving her too much.<br />
              Watch out for her; she can give you dreams.<br />
              She chews and swallows.<br />
              Don't fall asleep when she braids your hair.<br />
              She is the laugh; I am the laughter.<br />
              I watch the house; I watch the yard.<br />
              She left me.<br />
              Daddy is coming for us.<br />
